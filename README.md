University of Greenwwich project
Online GSU Election system

For future elections in University, I have created (school project) online election system.
The system lets every student to log in with his ID and password, choose a position they want to cast votes for and select 
the candidates they want to win by ordering them from 1st to 4th preference.
The system after that counts the votes and selects a winner, if there is a tie on votes for 1st preference on two or more candidates, the vote moves to the second preference and so on.
In order the system to work as expect and as close as a real-life election system, there are a couple of .txt files storing the necessary
information. The system reads from and writes in these files.
